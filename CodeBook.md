## For the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The following variables exist in the data set `Data_tidy.txt`:

* `SubjectID`: Unique identifier for each participant in the experiment.
* `Activity`: The activity performed by the subject while this measurement was recorded, as a factor variable.
              Levels are `LAYING`, `SITTING`, `STANDING`, `WALKING`, `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`, `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`
			 
The labels for the quantitative variables are explained in what follows. For a detailed description of what
each measurement corresponds to, see `features_info.txt` in the original Samsung UCI HAR data set.
Units for the measurements are not provided for the original data set, the documentation only says that 
features are normalized and bounded within the interval `[-1,1]`.

* `mean...`: Arithmetic means of the origninal measurements, additionally averaged for each subject and activity.
* `std...`: Standard deviations of the original measurements, additionally averaged for each subject and activity.
* `...X/Y/Z...`: Component of the original measurement in X, Y, and Z axial direction.
* `...t/f...`: Is this measurement in the time or frequency domain?
* `...Body/Gravity...`: Is this the component of acceleration due to body movement or the one due to gravity?
* `...Acc/Gyro...`: Does the measurement stem from the device's accelerometer or gyroscope (for angular velocity)?
* `...Jerk...`: The time derivative of the original acceleration or angular velocity measurement.
* `...Mag`: Variable is the magnitude (euclidean norm) of the measurement vector, rather than its X,Y, or Z component.
